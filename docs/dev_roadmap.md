## Guiding Principles

```text
1. START SMALL, EXPAND NATURALLY
   └─ Don't build everything at once
   └─ Each sprint adds one meaningful layer
   └─ Playable and interesting at every stage

2. VERTICAL SLICES
   └─ Complete one Forge before starting next
   └─ Each Forge is shippable independently
   └─ Can release early versions for feedback

3. TEST WITH REAL PLAYERS
   └─ Playtest every 2 weeks
   └─ User feedback shapes next sprint
   └─ Pivot if something isn't fun

4. OPEN DEVELOPMENT
   └─ Build in public (stream, blog, devlog)
   └─ Community involvement from day one
   └─ Early adopters = evangelists

5. SUSTAINABLE PACE
   └─ 24 months, not 24 months of crunch
   └─ Marathon, not sprint
   └─ Burnout kills projects

## Final Words

### The Journey Ahead

```
This roadmap is ambitious but achievable.

You're building something profound:
└─ A game about emergence
└─ That itself emerges from simple iterations
└─ And teaches emergence to players
└─ Who then see emergence everywhere

It's meta. It's beautiful. It's important.

The world needs games that teach systems thinking.
The world needs games that inspire awe.
The world needs YOUR game.

Start small. Ship often. Listen always.

From atoms to stars,
From chaos to creation,
From idea to reality.

You've got this.

Now go build Forge Cosmos. 🌌
```
