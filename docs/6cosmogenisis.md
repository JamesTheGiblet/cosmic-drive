# 🌌 Cosmogenesis - Cosmic Scale

## Overview

**Cosmogenesis is where civilizations become cosmic forces.** From planetary surfaces to stellar engineering to galactic colonization, this is the ultimate expression of emergence—life reshaping the universe itself.

### Design Goals

1. **Scale is visceral** - feel the enormity of space
2. **Physics matters** - realistic orbital mechanics, stellar evolution
3. **Life is rare** - emphasize the preciousness of consciousness
4. **Megastructures inspire awe** - Dyson spheres, ringworlds, matrioshka brains
5. **Cosmic perspective** - see Earth as pale blue dot, then transcend

### The Five Phases

```
PHASE 1: PLANETARY (Levels 12-25)
└─ Single world, terraform, understand home planet

PHASE 2: SYSTEM (Levels 26-35)
└─ Colonize moons/planets, asteroid mining, solar system mastery

PHASE 3: INTERSTELLAR (Levels 36-48)
└─ Reach nearby stars, generation ships, first exoplanets

PHASE 4: GALACTIC (Levels 49-75)
└─ Spread across galaxy, megastructures, Type II/III civilization

PHASE 5: UNIVERSAL (Levels 76-100)
└─ Multiple galaxies, cosmic engineering, approach godhood
```

## Cosmogenesis Visual Design

### Scale Transitions

```
SEAMLESS ZOOM (Eames "Powers of Ten"):

10⁰ m: Organism on surface
  ↓
10³ m: City visible
  ↓
10⁶ m: Continent
  ↓
10⁷ m: Whole planet
  ↓
10¹¹ m: Inner solar system
  ↓
10¹³ m: Outer solar system
  ↓
10¹⁶ m: Nearby stars
  ↓
10²⁰ m: Galaxy
  ↓
10²³ m: Local Group
  ↓
10²⁶ m: Observable universe

Player can smoothly zoom through all scales
└─ Never loading screens
└─ Continuous sense of place
└─ Visceral understanding of scale
```

### Stellar Beauty

```
STAR RENDERING:

Main Sequence:
├─ O-type: Blue-white, intensely bright
├─ B-type: Blue, hot
├─ A-type: White
├─ F-type: Yellow-white
├─ G-type: Yellow (like Sun)
├─ K-type: Orange
├─ M-type: Red, cool
└─ Each type visually distinct

Evolved Stars:
├─ Red giant: Enormous, ruddy glow
├─ White dwarf: Tiny, intensely white
├─ Neutron star: Spinning, magnetic beams
├─ Black hole: Invisible, accretion disk glowing
└─ Planetary nebula: Colorful expanding shells

Dynamic Effects:
├─ Coronal mass ejections
├─ Solar flares
├─ Stellar wind (particle streams)
├─ Sunspots (for sunlike stars)
└─ Authentic stellar physics
```

### Megastructure Grandeur

```
DYSON SPHERE:
├─ Glint of billions of mirrors
├─ Geometric patterns (orbital resonances)
├─ Infrared glow (heat radiation)
├─ Clearly artificial
└─ Awe-inspiring scale

RINGWORLD:
├─ Thin line across star
├─ Rotation visible (slight blur)
├─ Inner surface Earth-like
├─ Mind-boggling size
└─ Niven would approve

MATRIOSHKA BRAIN:
├─ Nested spheres (visible in cross-section)
├─ Pulsing with computation
├─ Data streams between layers
├─ Beautiful and alien
└─ Intelligence manifest

BIRCH PLANET:
├─ Shell around black hole
├─ Gravitational lensing (distorted space)
├─ City lights on inner surface
├─ Most improbable structure
└─ Ultimate achievement
```
